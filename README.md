# One-Inch-Photodetector
Photodiode transimpedance amplifier, on a one inch diameter (25 mm) circular 2-sided PCB - for mounting in standard 1" lens holders.

The board features low-noise LDOs LT3042 and LT3093 to produce +V and -V DC-rails for the op-amp. The photodiode footprint is TO-18, to fit e.g. Hamamatsu Si photodiodes S5973, S5972, S5973, or Thorlabs Si detectors FDS015, FDS025, FD11A, or Thorlabs InGaAs detectors such as FGA01, FGA01FC, FGA015, FDGA05, FD05D, FD10D.

The output-connector is MMCX, to fit the small board).

## SOT23 variant
This version of the detector is for a SOT23 op-amp such as OPA657, OPA847, and similar.

## WSON8 variant
This version is for modern op-amps in WSON8 footprint such as OPA855, OPA858, OPA859
